# web-week-2-cs-problem

For the next 30 minutes take turns with the person sitting next to you whiteboarding out solutions to the two following problems. Try to only use Ruby documentation as an outside resource.

## Problem1

"Given an array of numbers, write the method `move_zeroes()` method to move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

For example, given nums = `[0, 1, 0, 3, 12]`, after calling your method, nums should be `[1, 3, 12, 0, 0]`.

```ruby
def move_zeroes(nums)
zeros = nums.count{|n| n==0}
nums.delete(0)
zero.times {nums.push(0)}
end
```

## Problem2

"Given an array of integers that is already sorted in ascending order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

The method `two_sum` should return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

`Input: numbers=[2, 7, 11, 15], target=9`
`Output: {index1: 0, index2: 1}"`

```ruby
def two_sum(numbers, target)
    output =  {}
    numbers.each_with_index do |num, i| 
        numbers.each_with_index do |num2, i2|
        if num + num2 == target && i != i2
        output[:index1] = i
        output[:index2] = i2
        end 
    end
    end
    output
end
```
